Description: To make the semiparametric transformation models easier to apply in real studies, 
    we introduce this R package, in which the MLE in transformation models via 
    an EM algorithm proposed by Zeng D, Lin DY(2007) <doi:10.1111/j.1369-7412.2007.00606.x> 
    and adaptive lasso method in transformation models proposed by Liu XX, Zeng 
    D(2013) <doi:10.1093/biomet/ast029> are implemented.  
    C++ functions are used to compute complex loops. The coefficient vector and 
    cumulative baseline hazard function can be estimated, along with the 
    corresponding standard errors and P values.
